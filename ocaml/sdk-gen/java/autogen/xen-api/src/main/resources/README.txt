XenServerJava
=============

Copyright (c) 2007-2023 Cloud Software Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for XenServer, exposing the XenServer API as
Java classes.

XenServerJava includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to Java. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServerJava.
